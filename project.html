        <h1>Loss and Damage - The Unequal Cost of Climate Change </h1>

        <h2>Aims</h2>
        
        <p>Inspired by COP-27, I am looking quantitatively at the story behind the Loss and Damage Fund requested by 
            developing countries. My aim is to show, through data, the impact of climate change. I want to bring attention to countries 
            who are currently causing and have caused the most climate damage. I will investigate current evidence and vulnerability of 
            climate change, and quantify the costs that are brought by climate disasters.</p>
    </div> 
  
  <!-- A div that contains emissions.  -->
<div class="myWeek1">
        <h2>CO2 Emissions</h2>
        <h3>Figure 1 - CO2 Emissions per Capita </h3>
        <div class="chart2" id="Chart1"></div>
        <p>Figure 1 shows oil producing countries like Qatar have the highest CO2 emissions per capita, almost 7x the amount of the UK and 
            1300x the amount of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At first glance these oil producing countries look like they should 
            shoulder the responsibility for climate change.</p>


        <h3>Figure 2 - Cumulative CO2 Emissions</h3>
        <div class="chart2" id="Chart2"> </div>
        <p>However Figure 2 shows that since 1750 The United States is by far the largest emitter, with China a distant second. Looking again
            at Qatar, their cumulative emissions equal just 2.7% of the United Kingdom's cumulative emissions. </p>
        <p>This shows the imbalance of cumulative emissions where countries like Bangladesh, who are particularly vulnerable to flooding, barely move off the X-axis. 
            Hence, we have to compare the largest emitters to whole continents and geographical areas. Here I am bringing 
            attention to the countries that are most responsible for CO2 emissions.<p>

    <div class="myWeek1">
        <h2>Extreme Weather</h2>
        <h3>Figure 3 - Extreme Weather Events </h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"> </div> 
        <p>Extreme weather events are defined as weather at the extremes of the historical distributions; weather that is unexpected, unusual, 
            severe, or unseasonal. Figure 3 shows a clear general upwards trend in the number of extreme weather events. This correlates with 
            the steep increase in global carbon emissions since 1960, Figure 2.</p>

        <h3>Figure 4 - Extreme Weather Events Broken Down Into Disaster Sub-Type</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>
        <p> Figure 4 shows the frequency of different extreme weather events. All 6 natural disasters have large economic costs associated
             with them and can be extremely destructive. E.g. the 2022 flooding in Pakistan which caused damage exceeding USD 14.9 billion. Evidence of 
             correlation suggests we should expect an increase in frequency of extreme weather events, and an increase in corresponding 
             economic losses as a result.</p>

        <h2>Vulnerability to Climate Change: Will These Costs Be Evenly Distributed?</h2>

        <p> Vulnerability measures a country's exposure, sensitivity, and ability to adapt to the negative impact of climate change. 
            It measures the overall vulnerability by considering it in six life-supporting sectors – food, water, health, ecosystem 
            service, human habitat, and infrastructure.</p> 
            
        <p>Overall Risk Index summarizes a country's vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges in combination with its
             readiness to improve resilience, giving an overarching sense of the impacts of climate change. Readiness here measures a 
             country’s ability to leverage investments and convert them to adaptation actions.</p>

    <p>Non-Annex I parties are defined by the UN <a href="https://unfccc.int/parties-observers" target="_blank">here</a>. Residual

    <!-- A div that contains Conclusion.  -->

    <div class="myWeek1">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We can see from Figures 5, 6 & 7 that there are differing costs and vulnerabilities to climate change. Costs, Figure 6, 
            have a wide-ranging split between Adaption and Residual for different areas. Central Africa and parts of Asia are the 
            most vulnerable to climate change despite low carbon contributions.</p>
        <p>Despite having contributed the most to climate change, the US and Europe are not particularly at risk to the damages caused.</p>
        <p> The economic cost of climate change should not be underestimated, inaction could cost the world’s economy 
            USD 178 trillion by 2070. As shown, the effects of climate change are not just unequal but also inequitable. Loss and Damage 
            funds should be a necessary part of future environmental discussions paid by developed countries to developing countries.</p>

    <!-- A div that contains challenges.  -->

    <div class="myWeek1">
        <h2>Project Challenges</h2>
        <p>Most data was of CSV format but finding reliable data was challenging. Data preparation using Python was challenging
             as climate datasets are large and complex. Challenges were reindexing tables, dropping particular rows, and merging 
             and restricting data. Adding interactive features to Vega-lite using JavaScript was challenging too,  dealing with 
             time data was particularly hard to encode. I chose against using API’s as I am using historical data.</p>
            <p>I overcame challenges through additional research, experimentation and trial and error.</p>
