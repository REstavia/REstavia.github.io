        <h1>Loss & Damage - The Unequal Cost of Climate Change </h1>

        <h2>Aims</h2>
        
        <p>Inspired by the recent COP-27, I chose to look quantitatively at the story behind the Loss & Damage Fund requested by 
            developing countries. My aim was to show through data the impacts of climate change, bringing attention to countries 
            who are currently causing and have caused the most damage to the climate. I studied data from the natural world exploring 
            current evidence of climate change, then vulnerability to climate change, and finally quantifying the costs that are brought 
            by climate disasters through Loss & Damage. I wanted to show that developing countries will be forced to foot the majority of the
            bill for problems they played a minor part in causing.</p>

        <h2>CO2 Emissions</h2>
        <h3>Figure 1 - CO2 Emissions per Capita </h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
        <p>Figure 1 shows oil producing countries like Qatar have the highest CO2 emissions per capita, almost 7x the amount of the UK and 
            1300x the amount of The Democratic Republic of the Congo. At first glance these oil producing countries look like they should 
            shoulder the responsibility for climate change.</p>


        <h3>Figure 2 - Cumulative CO2 Emissions</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
        <p>However Figure 2 shows that since 1750 The United States is by far the largest emitter, with China a distant second. Once again
            looking at Qatar, their total emissions equal just 2.7% of the United Kingdoms total emissions. </p>
        <p>Such is the imbalance of cumulative emissions, countries like Bangladesh, who are particularly vulnerable to flooding, barely move 
            off the x-axis. Hence, we have to compare the largest emitters to whole continents and geographical areas. Here I am bringing 
            attention to the countries that are most responsible for CO2 emissions.<p>

            </p> and have had time to reduce their annual emissions.</p>
        
       <p> The data for Figure 1 was downloaded as a <a href="https://github.com/REstavia/REstavia.github.io/blob/main/co-emissions-per-capita.csv"

    <div class="myWeek1">
        <h2>Extreme Weather</h2>
        <h3>Figure 3 - Extreme Weather Events </h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"> </div> 
        <p>Extreme weather events are defined as weather at the extremes of the historical distributions; weather that is unexpected, unusual, 
            severe, or unseasonal. Figure 3 shows a clear general upwards trend in the number of extreme weather events. This correlates with 
            the steep increase in global carbon emissions since 1960, Figure 2.</p>

        <h3>Figure 4 - Extreme Weather Events Broken Down Into Disaster Sub-Type</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>
        <p> Figure 4 shows the frequency of different extreme weather events. All 6 natural disasters have large economic costs associated
             with them and can be extremely destructive. 2021 floods in Pakistan caused damage exceeding USD 14.9 billion. Evidence of 
             correlation suggests we should expect an increase in frequency of extreme weather events, and an increase in corresponding 
             economic losses as a result.</p>

    <div class="myWeek1"> 
        <h2>Vulnerability to Climate Change: Will These Costs Be Evenly Distributed?</h2>

        <p> Vulnerability measures a country's exposure, sensitivity, and ability to adapt to the negative impact of climate change. 
            It measures the overall vulnerability by considering it in six life-supporting sectors – food, water, health, ecosystem 
            service, human habitat, and infrastructure.</p> 
            
        <p>Overall Risk Index summarizes a country's vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges in combination with its
             readiness to improve resilience, giving an overarching sense of the impacts of Climate change. Readiness here measures a 
             country’s ability to leverage investments and convert them to adaptation actions.</p>

    <div class="myWeek1">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We can see from Figures 5, 6 & 7 that there is differing costs and vulnerabilities to climate change. Costs, Figure 6, 
            have a wide-ranging split between Adaption and Residual for different areas. Central Africa and parts of Asia are the 
            most vulnerable to climate change despite low carbon contributions.</p>
        <p>Despite having contributed the most to climate change, The US and Europe are not particularly at risk to the damages caused.</p>
        <p> The economic costs of climate change should not be underestimated, inaction on climate change could cost the world’s economy 
            USD 178 trillion by 2070. As shown, the impact of climate change is therefore not just unequal but inequitable. Loss and Damage 
            funds should be a necessary part of future environmental discussions paid by developed countries to developing Countries.</p>

    <!-- A div that contains challenges.  -->

    <div class="myWeek1">
        <h2>Project Challenges</h2>
        <p>Most data was of CSV/Excel format but finding reliable, accurate data was challenging. Data preparation using Python 
            was challenging as climate datasets are large and complex. Challenges were reindexing tables, dropping 
            particular rows, and merging and restricting the data. Adding interactive features to Vega-lite using JavaScript was challenging too, 
            namely figuring out how to encode different layers correctly and getting them working. Dealing with time data was particularly 
            hard to encode.</p>
            <p>I overcame challenges through lots of google research and trial and error of the results.</p>
